…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# Github_AUTH" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajat3204/Github_AUTH.git
git push -u origin main
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajat3204/Github_AUTH.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git pull  # use to pull the changes from the git repo . It doesn't need any authentication.
